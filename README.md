# Traffic-Analysis
PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on traffic data preprocessing and analysis for Nammakal District.
The aim is to clean raw traffic data and prepare it for machine learning and data analysis tasks.

Dataset Details
Raw Dataset
File: "C:\Users\YALINI R\Downloads\namakkal_traffic_1500rows_25columns_uncleaned.csv"
Description:
This file contains the original, unprocessed traffic data collected for Namakkal District.
Issues in raw data:
Missing values
Categorical (text) data
Different value ranges
Preprocessed Dataset
File: "C:\Users\YALINI R\Downloads\second_dataset_place_updated.csv"
Description:
This file contains the cleaned and transformed version of the raw dataset, ready for analysis and machine learning.
Data Preprocessing Steps
Missing values were handled

Numerical columns filled using mean
Categorical columns filled using mode
Categorical features were converted into numerical values using label encoding

Feature scaling was applied using Min-Max normalization to bring all values into a 0–1 range

Tools and Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
GitHub
Applications
Traffic congestion prediction
Accident risk analysis
Data visualization dashboards

Conclusion
The preprocessing steps ensure that the dataset is clean, consistent, and suitable for further analysis and machine learning models.
